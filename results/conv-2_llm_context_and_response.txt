DOCTOR: Hello. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, doctor. I've been having some stomach discomfort and occasional nausea.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: It started about three days ago. Especially after meals, I feel bloated and sometimes nauseous.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or appetite?
PATIENT: Yes, my appetite has decreased a bit and sometimes I feel constipated.
DOCTOR: Any other symptoms like fever or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever yet, just some mild vomiting once or twice.
DOCTOR: Are you under any particular stress or have you changed your diet recently?
PATIENT: I have been really busy at work, and I think I’ve been eating more fast food than usual.
DOCTOR: Thanks for sharing that. It’s important we keep track of these symptoms. Please let me know if anything else develops.
PATIENT: Will do, doctor. Thank you.
